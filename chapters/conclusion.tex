The modularity of SegMatch allows for use in different scenarios, and as demonstrated in Chapter \ref{chap:ae}, allows work on improving SegMatch to easily be constrained to a single module.\\

The autoencoder neural network has shown promising capabilities as a descriptor. It can be retrained after every few runs, thus continually learning from new data collected from its environment. We believe that the knowledge stored in the autoencoder model can be used to not only complement mapping within SegMatch, but also provide useful descriptions of the environment for other processes in autonomous robots.\\

Future goals for SegMatch include: Improving the generalisation ability of the algorithm. Improving SegMatch performance. Design a segmentation algorithm producing useful segments in every environment. Improving the loop-closure detection process to automatically detect erroneous loop closures. Increase the quantity and reliability of detected loop closures.\\

Future goals for the learning module include: Evaluate other potential architectures. Assess wether deeper models achieve useful improvements in segment reconstruction and description. Increase resolution of voxelized segments.\\
