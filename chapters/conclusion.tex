The modularity of SegMatch allows for use in different scenarios, and as demonstrated in Chapter \ref{chap:ae}, allows work on improving SegMatch to easily be constrained to a single module.

The autoencoder neural network can be retrained after every few runs, thus continually learning from new data collected from its environment.
