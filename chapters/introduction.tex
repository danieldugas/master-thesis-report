\section{Motivation for Range-Based SLAM}
\label{sec:motivation}

Range-based sensors allow for confidence in actual distance between sensor and objects. As a result, they are, and or are becoming common in scenarios where failure to properly identify the depth of objects in the scenery can lead to serious damage and consequences.\\%TODO cite self driving cars

Though vision-based SLAM is a thoroughly investigated topic, the data produced by range sensors is usually quite qualitatively different from 2D data, or vision-extracted 3D data. Registration patterns (such as scan-lines visible in data taken by rotating-LiDAR), for example, are a challenge which particularly affects range-based data.\\
