\label{chap:segmatchAE}

This Chapter details the work following the implementation of SegMatch. In this part of the project, the goal was to design and implement a learning descriptor, that would improve the quality of descriptions and matches.\\

Recent work is showing neural networks as a versatile and promising machine learning technique. Despite initial promise in the years following the invention of the Perceptron \cite{perceptron} in 1958, neural networks did not show useful results, or superiority to other machine learning algorithms on many problems for some time. In the recent years (2006-) however, breakthrough results in the fields of audio (see WaveNet \cite{wavenet}), visual (see ? \cite{inception?}), natural language processing (see ? \cite{?}), game-agent (see AlphaGo \cite{alphago}), to cite a few, have led to increased research effort and adoption in consumer \cite{snapchat-face-recognition} and business \cite{google-cooling} technologies.\\

There is little doubt that neural networks can also be useful in the robotics field. With this in mind, and based on pre-existing research on classifying 3D segments using neural networks (see Subsection~\ref{subsec:voxnet}), it was decided that neural networks were an ideal test subject for improving SegMatch performance.\\

The description step was seen as showing the most potential for improvement. Thus, it was selected as the section of the algorithm to be supplemented with a neural network model.\\
